# web-scrapers
This is a small sample of publicly available web scrapers I have built to date. I will continue to make more web scrapers public and add new crawlers based on public feedback and requests.

To view the scrapers I have built, please navigate to crawlers/crawlers/spiders.

Note: These scrapers will not directly run, since I have removed a lot of key files and connections. This repo only exists to showcase my code portfolio.
